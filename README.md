# quickstart-sap-netweaver-abap
## SAP NetWeaver on the AWS Cloud


This Quick Start automatically deploys an SAP NetWeaver Application Server (AS) environment for Advanced Business Application Programming (ABAP) on the AWS Cloud.

SAP NetWeaver provides a set of technologies for developing and running SAP applications. SAP products and applications such as SAP Business Suite, S/4HANA, SAP Business Warehouse (SAP BW), and SAP BW/4HANA rely on SAP NetWeaver. This Quick Start deploys SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP, which supports the development of ABAP-based applications for SAP HANA databases.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying SAP NetWeaver into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) that's configured for security, scalability, and high availability 
- Deploying SAP NetWeaver into an existing VPC in your AWS account

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.

The deployment and configuration tasks are automated by AWS CloudFormation templates that you can customize during launch. The deployment guide provides architectural details and step-by-step deployment instructions.
